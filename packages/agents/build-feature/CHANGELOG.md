## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- f99dcc2: New `/aspira-build-feature` skill: a skill-only package, `@aspiralabs/build-feature`, that steps a deterministic driver through the whole AI-DLC process for a Feature Board ticket — idea to a reviewed, merge-ready PR — running each stage as a subagent of a `--local` Claude Code session instead of launching an agent. `kit init` installs it with the other `/aspira-*` skills via `@aspiralabs/agents`.

  `groomer`, `spec-writer`, `spec-reviewer` and `planner` take a shared `--take-recommended` option that answers non-exit-criteria questions with the recommended choice instead of asking, so build-feature's steps can run unattended; the decision records which answers were agent-taken so a rerun or a human override can tell. `@aspiralabs/kit` now exports a `playbook` entry point (`@aspiralabs/kit/playbook`) that build-feature's driver imports to route each ticket Status.

  `/aspira-build-feature` runs in two modes: with `--local` every step skill runs with `--local` in the session; without it every step runs its skill's default cloud-agent mode and the run waits on it (the mode is in the run state and the Build Summary). Each run works the ticket in its own git worktree, `.worktrees/<TYPE>-<ID>` on `<feat|fix|chore>/<id>-<slug>` from the card's Type, and pushes with `git push -u origin HEAD` from there. `@aspiralabs/agent-common`'s `resolve-ticket` script now also prints the card's `type`.

  The project gate runs every command with credentials (Notion, GitHub, npm, AI Gateway tokens and any `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`, `*_KEY` or `*_PASSWORD` variable) removed from its environment. In cloud mode, gate scripts in `package.json` that differ from `origin/main` are shown to the human as a diff and run only on their "run" answer.
