Run telemetry: every run of an `/aspira-*` skill on a ticket writes one OpenTelemetry JSON file, `.work/<id>-<slug>/telemetry/<run-id>.json`, with the run's timings and, where they are measured, its tokens, tool calls and cost per phase or subagent. When the Feature Board rules list the run telemetry file (BOARD-003), the file is attached to the end of the ticket page as one file block. A telemetry failure is only a notice: it never changes a run's status, a card's move or an exit code.

- Default (cloud) runs: `ticket.ts start` prints `run-id=` and `run-started=`; every launcher passes them back to `ticket.ts finish` as `--run-id` and `--run-started`, which writes the file from the agent's usage file and attaches it.
- `--local` runs: the session writes a session usage report for its subagents (`<export>/trace/session-usage.json`; code-analyzer's `.static-analysis/session-usage.json`), the driver prints where and for which run id, writes the file at the export, and lists a `read board-rules` and an `attach` action; the session passes the attach result to the verify step with the new `--attach '{"blockId": …}'` option.
- `--parent-run <run-id>:<nonce>`: every launcher and local driver accepts it (a malformed value is refused, exit 3, naming the option). It marks a step of an `/aspira-build-feature` run, which writes and attaches no telemetry of its own.
- `/aspira-build-feature` writes one telemetry file per run with its steps, their subagents and the orchestration, adds a Run telemetry table to the Build Summary, attaches the file in a new `telemetry` stage, and refuses to start a step when a step skill's `.kit-version` is not its own version (`kit init` fixes it).
