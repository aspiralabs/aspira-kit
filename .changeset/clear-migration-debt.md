`@aspiralabs/ui`: the 43 JSX ternaries that came over from SAAS_BOILER are rewritten (lookup maps, early-return helpers, precomputed props) and the package-level lint exemption is removed, so the org's no-ternary rule now holds inside the ui package. No rendered output changes. `@aspiralabs/config`: first two agent guides, `table-pagination` and `choosing-a-selector`.
