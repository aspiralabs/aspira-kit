`/aspira-groomer <ID>` grooms a Backlog card before it reaches Ready: Idea: it moves the card Idea → Grooming, interviews the author in rounds on the ticket's Grooming Decisions page, grounded in the repository, and on Confirm writes the settled Decisions and Terms into the Idea and moves the card to Shortlist; moving it on to Ready: Idea stays the human's step. `kit init` installs the seventh skill, `@aspiralabs/agents` brings in `@aspiralabs/groomer`, and `kit next` sends Idea and Grooming cards to the groomer. The spec writer, spec reviewer, planner and implementor treat a groomed spec's `## Decisions` section as settled and do not reopen it.

Also in `@aspiralabs/agent-common`: the Idea a ticket pull reads now ends at the next heading of its own level or shallower, so `###` subsections under `## Idea` (the groomer's Decisions and Terms) reach every skill's `idea.md`; a ticket page Notion truncates is refused instead of read partially.
